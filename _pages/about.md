<div align="justify">I am a researcher and a PhD candidate working in the area of Reinforcement Learning. I am a member of the  <a href="https://machineteaching.mpi-sws.org/index.html">Machine Teaching Group</a> at the <a href="https://www.mpi-sws.org/">Max Planck Institute of Software Systems </a>, working under the supervision of Dr. <a href="https://www.mpi-sws.org/people/adishs/">Adish Singla</a>. I am interested in making Reinforcement Learning agents train more efficiently with fewer interactions with their environment. We get inspired by human learning and design curriculum strategies that help agents learn faster. </div>

In the past, I have worked as a Data Scientist and Computer Vision Engineer in the industry.
