<div align="justify">I am a researcher and a PhD candidate working in the area of Reinforcement Learning. I am a member of the  <a href="https://machineteaching.mpi-sws.org/index.html">Machine Teaching Group</a> at the <a href="https://www.mpi-sws.org/">Max Planck Institute of Software Systems </a>, working under the supervision of Dr. <a href="https://www.mpi-sws.org/people/adishs/">Adish Singla</a>. I am interested in making Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents train more efficiently with fewer interactions with their environment. We get inspired by human learning and design curriculum strategies that help agents learn faster. Currently, we are investigating how curriculum and reinforcement learning (RL) can assist in designing cost-efficient Large Language Models (LLMs). </div>

In the past, I have worked as a Data Scientist and Computer Vision Engineer in the industry.
